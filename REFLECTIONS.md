// What patterns or surprises did you notice? 
In the program I did not notice too many surprises the program occured how I predicted it would. I would say the only difference between this my prediction and the results is how the isEven() and isOdd() function worked. Initially I used the division symbol with a equal operator to determine even or odd, but then I remembered to use the percentage sign.
//What logic challenged your thinking? 
My thinking was challenged by how we determine what is even or odd. It took me some time to rack my brain around it initially 
// How might this kind of toolkit be used in the real world? 
I could see this being used in the real world as a calculator program. It could also be used for someone who wants to some quick financial analysis work.
